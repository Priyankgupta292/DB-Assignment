# Answer1

1. The relationship between the **"Product"** and **"Category"** entities is established through a reference in the ProductSchema. Specifically, the **category_id** field in the ProductSchema is a reference to a document in the **"Category"** collection.

2. This means that each product document can be associated with a category document by storing the _id of the corresponding category document in the category_id field of the product document.

3. With this setup, we can perform operations like fetching all products belonging to a specific category or retrieving the category information for a particular product by populating the category_id field when querying the "Product" collection.


In summary, the relationship between "Product" and "Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship, where each product belongs to one category, and each category can have multiple products associated with it.

With the following way we can make sure that each Product in Product schema has a valid category assigned to it

```javascript
const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    // Other fields...
    category_id: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "Category",
        required: true // Ensure category_id is required
    },
    // Other fields...
});

// Define foreign key constraint
ProductSchema.path('category_id').validate(async function(value) {
    const Category = mongoose.model('Category');
    const category = await Category.findById(value);
    return category !== null; // Return true if category exists, false otherwise
}, 'Invalid category');

// Example usage: Query products and populate the category
const products = await Product.find().populate('category_id');

```
